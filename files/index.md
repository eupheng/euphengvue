# Hello

#### My name is Eupheng Vue.

This is a place for me to gather information, ideas, thoughts, and resources on my interests in and out of the interwebs.

I enjoy learning about peer to peer opensource technologies, unix-like operating systems such as [FreeBSD](https://freebsd.org), [Debian](https://debian.org), and [OpenBSD](https://openbsd.org).

Slowly, learning to pick up the languages and operating systems that keeps the internet running.
